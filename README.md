# Sea dispersal potential and colonization of the Galápagos littoral flora

##Abstract. Seed dispersal by oceanic currents (thalassochory) is considered one of the main long-distance dispersal (LDD) mechanisms for the colonization of oceanic islands by plants. The diaspores of littoral species are often hypothesized to be physiologically adapted to sea conditions, including sea-water  dispersal,  likely favouring inter-island colonization. In this study, we experimentally tested the Sea Dispersal Potential (SDP) of a large proportion of Galápagos littoral flora and explored its correlation with plant distribution across the archipelago. We propose a simple SDP index to quantify thalassochorous potential for island colonization. We combined information on seed floatability (flotation time) and viability experiments (tetrazolium test) into an  SDP index for nineteen native littoral plants and tested whether increasing dispersal potential is associated with broader plant distributions across the Galápagos. We then tested if the presence of visible morphological structures related to thalassochory is associated with the functional SDP index. We observed a relatively low but highly variable SDP across Galapagos littoral plant species. No correlation was found between the SDP index and species distribution. Morphological traits related to thalassochory are not related to the thalassorous potential to reach the closest islands, but they are positively associated with SDP for reaching the farthest islands. The proposed SDP index was shown to be useful to compare the potential of entire floras for thalassochory in a given geographical context. The low performance shown by the majority of tested species questions the general assumption that most littoral plants are highly adapted to long-distance sea dispersal. Our results support the view that island colonization is a multifactorial process. Further research should integrate functional indices (such as SDP) with complementary tools (e.g. genetics, remote diaspore tracking) to determine the drivers of species dispersal and establishment on oceanic islands.
